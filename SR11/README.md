They must be cleared by SR11 and command beforehand, otherwise you may be let down once it's done.

####Setting up CBA framework
I would prefer mods to be built using the CBA framework, however, if the mod is simple, build it how you like.
If it involves more than a couple of scripts/features, then use the CBA framework.
Follow the ACE3 guide on how to set this up.
Certain areas will not apply (you don't need to clone ACE3, for example)
Best talk to SqnLdr.Beswick.T for help on setting this up.
